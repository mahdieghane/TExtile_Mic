# iWood: Makeable Vibration Sensor for Interactive Plywood

## About
iWood is interactive plywood that can sense vibration based on triboelectric effect. As a material, iWood survives common woodworking operations, such as sawing, screwing, and nailing and can be used to create furniture and artifacts. Things created using iWood inherit its sensing capability and can detect a variety of user input and activities based on their unique vibration patterns.
